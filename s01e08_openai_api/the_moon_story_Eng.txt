I had a morning coffee, walked into the cockpit, and took off with my spaceship to the moon. I landed on the moon, and got out to explore. I found a strange cave, and went inside. Suddenly, I was attacked by a group of aliens! I fought them off, and made my way deeper into the cave. I found a secret alien laboratory, where they were experimenting on humans. I freed the humans, and destroyed the laboratory. Then I made my way back to my ship, and took off for home.
